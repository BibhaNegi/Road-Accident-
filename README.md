November recording the highest accident rate at 39,414 incidents. 
Performed monthly and geographic trend analysis, pinpointing that urban areas contributed to 60% of total accidents, while rural areas saw higher fatality rates.
Additionally, analysis revealed that weekends accounted for almost 35%  of all accidents, and rainy conditions led to a 25% increase in accidents.
